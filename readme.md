## Description:
	My project, Bike Swap, is a web application that helps cycling enthusiasts connect to try out, buy, sell and trade bike parts within their community.  The user is able to register, log in, create a personal profile where they can upload pictures and add/remove parts from their database as well as search for user's near them and search for parts.  When a user is interested in another user's parts they can request the part by a form which emails their information and what part they are interested in to the other user.
